## OUTLINE

This library records the statistics information of run-time performance and the trace information of a user code and reports its summary. The PMlib is able to use for both serial and parallel environments including hybrid(OpenMP & MPI) code. In addition, PAPI interface allows us to access the information of build-in hardware counter.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT
- Linux OS or UNIX OS
- Compilers for C/C++/Fortran
- Cmake
- MPI library  (optional)
- PAPI library (optional)
- Power API library (optional)
- OTF library (optional)

Although MPI and PAPI libraries are optional, they provide the essential multiprocessing capability
and the hardware performance measurement capability, so are strongly recommended to be included in PMlib
building process.

## HOW TO BUILD

Before starting the installation, users should confirm if the software requirement is met.  
Then, download the PMlib package tar ball to some directory and unpack it.
The distribution files can be found under the directory PMlib-${version}. Current version is 10.2.
If the user downloads the tar ball to ${HOME}/pmlib and unpack it there, the distribution
directory becomes ${HOME}/pmlib/PMlib-10.0  
Set the shell variable PACKAGE\_DIR pointing to such distribution directory.
```
	PACKAGE_DIR=${HOME}/pmlib/PMlib-10.0
```  
The installation will proceed under the subdirectory ${PACKAGE\_DIR}/BUILD.  
Users should also set the shell variable PMLIB\_DIR pointing to the installation destination directory.
```
	PMLIB_DIR=${HOME}/usr_local_pmlib
```  
Using these shell variables, users should prepare a shell script file describing the build commands.
The structure of the build commands is as simple as below.
The only part which needs careful setup is the options to cmake command.


### Build commands

~~~
$ cd $PACKAGE_DIR
$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD
$ cmake [options] ../
$ # edit two files as shown below before doing make, when building python interface with PyBind11
$ make
$ make install
~~~

$ sed -i 's/-DCMAKE_INSTALL_DO_STRIP=1//g' src_pybind/Makefile
~~~

### Cmake options

`-D INSTALL_DIR=`_directory_

>  Specify the installation destination directory.
PMlib libraries will be installed under _directory_/lib and the header files under _directory_/include.
It is recommended to set a shell variable PMLIB\_DIR as described above and use it for _directory_,
i.e. `-D INSTALL_DIR=${PMLIB_DIR}`.
The default _directory_ is /usr/local/PMlib, which usually requires privilege.

`-D with_MPI=` {no | yes}

>  Setting this option "yes" specifies building PMlib with MPI library.
If you link your application with MPI, then PMlib also has to be built `with_MPI=yes`.

`-D enable_OPENMP=` {no | yes}

> Setting this option "yes" enables measuring OpenMP threads.

`-D with_PAPI=` {no | yes |_directory_}

>  Setting this option "yes" or _directory_ specifies building PMlib with PAPI library
for automated hardware counter measurement.  
`-Dwith_PAPI=yes` option can detect the system provided default PAPI library in usual cases.
However in certain cases, users have to specify the appropriate PAPI _directory_ explicitly.
An example of this is the cross-compiling environment.
In the cross-compiling environment, there can be multiple PAPI libraries on the system,
one for the current platform and another for the target platform.
See examples in 4. INSTALLATION EXAMPLES section.
Another example of this is when the OS provided PAPI library is obsolete for some reason,
and the appropriate PAPI is installed under some alternative directory.

`-D with_POWER=` {no | yes | _directory_}

>  This option is exclusively available on supercomputer Fugaku and on FX1000 systems.
Power API developed by Sandia National Laboratory is integrated into PMlib.
Specifying `-Dwith_POWER=yes` should detect the correct path on these systems.
In case not, specify this option with _directory_ pointing to the installed Power API library.

`-D with_OTF=` {no | _directory_}

>  This option is for linkling OTF (Open Trace Format) library with PMlib.
Specify this option with the _directory_ pointing to the installed OTF library.

`-D enable_PreciseTimer=` {no| yes}

> This option enables the precise timer for high resolution measurement.
Precise timers are currently supported for supercomputer Fugaku, Fujitsu FX1000, Intel Xeon servers.
Setting this option "yes" is equivalent to adding the C++ compiler option `-D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DUSE\_PRECISE\_TIMER"`

`-D with_example=` {no| yes}

>  This option turns on compiling example codes. Default is no.

`-D enable_Fortran=` {no | yes}

> This option turns on compiling a fortran example code. Default is no.

`-D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="C++ compiler flags"`

>  This option can be used for specifying C++ compiler flags in string format.

`-D CMAKE_C_FLAGS="C compiler flags"`

>  This option can be used for specifying C compiler flags in string format.
  Note that C compiler is necessary only if example codes are compiled, i.e. `-D with_example=yes`.

`-D CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="Fortran compiler flags"`

>  This option can be used for specifying Fortran compiler flags in string format.
  Note that Fortran compiler is necessary only if example codes are compiled, i.e. `-D with_example=yes`.

`-D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="file-name"`

>  This option can be used for specifying a predefined toolchain file "file-name" for a specific platforms.

### Default option values
~~~
with_MPI = no
enable_OPENMP = no
with_PAPI = no
with_POWER = no
with_OTF = no
enable_PreciseTimer = no
with_example = no
enable_Fortran = no
~~~

CC/CXX/F90/FC and other environment variables must be set for choosing the right compilers.
The default compiler options are described in `cmake/CompilerOptionSelector.cmake` file.
See BUILD OPTION section in CMakeLists.txt for details.

## RUNNING THE APPLICATION WITH PMLIB

There are several documents explaining how to run the application with PMlib, and how to understand the output information.
Currently, they are all written in Japanese.

Readme.md      : This document
doc/Readme.md  : How to generate the detail API specification with Doxygen
doc/tutorial/PMlib-Getting-Started.pdf      : Quick start guide


## RUN TIME ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

When running applications linked with PMlib, the following environment variables can be set to the shell.

`PMLIB_REPORT=(BASIC|DETAIL|FULL)`

This environment variable controlls the level of details in the PMlib performance statistics report.
The value BASIC will provide the summary report of the averaged values of the all processes.
The value DETAIL will provide the statistics report for all the processes.
The value FULL will provide the statistics report for all the threads of all the processes.
Note that the amount of the report is decided by the number of processes, the number of threads, the choice of HWPC_CHOOSER.

`HWPC_CHOOSER=(FLOPS|BANDWIDTH|VECTOR|LOADSTORE|CACHE|CYCLE)`

If this environment variable is set, PMlib automatically detects the PAPI based hardware counters. If this environment variable is not set, the HWPC counters are not reported.
To enable this feature, PMlib must be built with PAPI option enabled.

`POWER_CHOOSER=(NODE|NUMA|PARTS|OFF)`

If this environment variable is set, PMlib detects the POWER API supported devices and collect the data from them.
The power consumption information is recorded in rather coarse manner, and the overhead to collect the data
from those devices tends to be heavy. It is recommended to set this value as OFF (default) 
for the measurement that requires precise time resolution.
To enable this feature, PMlib must be built with Power API option enabled.

`BYPASS_PMLIB=YES`

This environment variable disable PMlib measurements. The PMlib APIs return immediately with no effects.

`OTF_TRACING=(off|on|full)`

If this environment variable is set, PMlib automatically generates the Open Trace Format files for post processing.
To enable this feature, PMlib must be built with OTF tracing option enabled.
There will be three type of OTF files.

~~~
  ${OTF_FILENAME}.otf
  ${OTF_FILENAME}.0.def
  ${OTF_FILENAME}.(1|2|..|N).events
~~~

See the next environment variable `OTF_FILENAME`. If the value is "off" or not defined, the OTF files are not produced. If the value is "on", the OTF files will contain the timer information only. If the value is "full", the OTF files will contain the counter information as well as the timer information. Remark that `OTF_TRACING=full` may yield the heavy overhead, if the measuring sections are repeated many times.

`OTF_FILENAME="some file name"`

The value of `${OTF_FILENAME}` is used to prefix the OTF file names if the value of previous `${OTF_TRACING}` has been set to "on" or "full". If this environment variable is not set, the default value of `"pmlib_optional_otf_files"` is used to prefix the OTF file names.


## EXAMPLES

* If you specify the test option by `-Denable_example=yes`, you can
execute the intrinsic tests by;

	`$ make test` or `$ ctest`

* The detailed results are written in `BUILD/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log` file.
Meanwhile, the summary is displayed for stdout.


## Remark on PAPI interface

Note that the default PAPI library provided with distro Operating System may not be best built for the
specific CPU type. In such case, users may choose to build PAPI library using the latest distribution
for their environment. The latest package and the build instructions are available from PAPI home page.

Typically, the Linux PAPI installation on Intel Xeon processors can be as simple as the example below.

~~~
$ ./configure --prefix=${PREFIX} CC=icc F77=ifort
$ make
$ make install-all
~~~


### Remark on Max_nthreads parameter

Maximum number of the measuable threads per process can be configured. The default is 48.
It is recommended to set this parameter accrding to the actual CPU hardware configuration.
Change the value of `const int Max_nthreads` in `~/include/pmlib_papi.h`, and build.
